Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding


1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =select count(business_id)=10000
					from attribute

ii. Business table =select count(id)=10000
					from business
iii. Category table =select count(business_id)=10000
					from category
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =		select count(id)=10000  =  10000 (id)
					from business              

ii. Hours =			select count(distinct business_id) = 1562 (business_id)
					from hours

iii. Category =		select count(distinct business_id)	= 2643    (business_id)
					from category

iv. Attribute =		select count(distinct business_id)  = 1115	(business_id)
					from attribute

v. Review =			select count(distinct business_id)  = 8090
                    from review
                    select count(distinct id)          =  10000
					from review
					select count(distinct user_id)    =  9581
					from review
vi. Checkin =       select count(distinct business_id)  = 493
                    from checkin 
vii. Photo =		10000	(id),		6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 		537	(user_id),      3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 			10000	(id)
x. Friend = 		11	(user_id)
